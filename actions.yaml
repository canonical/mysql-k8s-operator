  params:
    force:
      type: boolean
      default: False
      description: |
        Whether to ignore cluster health concerns and create the backup regardless.
        Use it with caution, as it can potentially create a backup from stale data.

list-backups:
  description: List available backup_ids in the S3 bucket and path provided by the S3 integrator charm.

  description: Restore a database backup using xtrabackup.
    S3 credentials are retrieved from a relation with the S3 integrator charm.

create-replication:
  description: |
    Create replication between two related clusters.
    This action is must be run on the offer side of the relation.
  params:
    name:
      type: string
      description: A (optional) name for this replication.
      default: default

promote-to-primary:
  description: |
    Promotes the unit or cluster to become the primary in the cluster or cluster-set, depending on
    the scope (unit or cluster). Used for safe switchover or failover.
    When in cluster scope, can only be run against the charm leader unit of a standby cluster.
  params:
    scope:
      type: string
      description: Whether to promote a unit or a cluster. Must be set to either `unit` or `cluster`.
      enum: [unit, cluster]
    force:
      type: boolean
      default: False
      description: |
        For cluster scope, use force when previous primary is unreachable (failover). Will invalidate previous
        primary.
        For unit scope, use force to force quorum from the current unit. Note that this operation is DANGEROUS
        as it can create a split-brain if incorrectly used and should be considered a last resort. Make
        absolutely sure that there are no partitions of this group that are still operating somewhere in
        the network, but not accessible from your location

recreate-cluster:
  description: |
    Recreates cluster on one or more standalone units that were previously part of a standby cluster.

    When a standby cluster is removed from an async replication relation, the cluster will be dissolved and
    each unit will be kept in blocked status. Recreating the cluster allows to rejoin the async replication
    relation, or usage as a standalone cluster.

rejoin-cluster:
  description: |
    Rejoins an invalidated cluster to the cluster-set, after a previous failover or switchover.
  params:
    cluster-name:
      type: string
      description: |
