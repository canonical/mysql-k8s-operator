"""Library to provide hardware architecture checks for VMs and K8s charms.

the is-wrong-architecture helper function, as follows:

from charms.mysql.v0.architecture import WrongArchitectureWarningCharm, is_wrong_architecture

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if is_wrong_architecture():
        main(WrongArchitectureWarningCharm)
