# MySQL k8s Charmed Operator

## Description

The [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) operator provides an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). This repository contains a Juju Charm for deploying MySQL on Kubernetes clusters.

This charm is currently in development, with High Availability via Group Replication as a short-term goal.

## Usage

To deploy this charm using Juju 2.9.0 or later, run:

```shell
juju add-model mysql-k8s
juju deploy mysql-k8s --trust
```

**Note**: the `--trust` flag is required when relating using `mysql_client` interface.

To confirm the deployment, you can run:

```shell
juju status --color
```

Once MySQL starts up, it will be running on the default port (3306).

If required, you can remove the deployment completely by running:

```shell
juju destroy-model -y mysql-k8s --destroy-storage
```

Note: the `--destroy-storage` will delete any data persisted by MySQL.

## Relations

There are no relations implemented yet.

## OCI Images

This charm by default uses the latest version of the [ubuntu/mysql](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubuntu/mysql) image.
