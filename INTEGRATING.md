## Integrating MySQL

MySQL integrates with any charm that supports the `mysql_datastore` interface. This integration is done using the MySQL Charm library. The documentation of the charm library, available through [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/mysql-k8s) provides further details on how this integration may be done.
