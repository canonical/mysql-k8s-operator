The charm follows [standard Juju applications statuses](https://juju.is/docs/olm/status-values#heading--application-status). Here you can find the expected end-users reaction on different statuses:

| Juju Status | Message | Expectations | Actions |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **active** | any | Normal charm operations | No actions required |
| **waiting** | any | Charm is waiting for relations to be finished | No actions required |
| **maintenance** | any | Charm is performing the internal maintenance (e.g. cluster re-configuration) | No actions required |
| **blocked** | any | The manual user activity is required! | Follow the message hints (see below) |
| **blocked** | Failed to set up relation | The relation between two applications failed to be created. Most probably it is a regression of the recent changes in applications | Check Juju [debug-log](https://juju.is/docs/olm/juju-debug-log). Increase debug level and reproduce the issue. Report as an issue with debug logs attached (if reproducible). Consider to try previous revision for both applications |
| **blocked** | Failed to initialize mysql relation | The same as "Failed to set up relation" | See "Failed to set up relation" |
