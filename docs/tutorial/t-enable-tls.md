# Enable encryption with TLS

[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is a protocol used to encrypt data exchanged between two applications. Essentially, it secures data transmitted over a network.

Typically, enabling TLS internally within a highly available database or between a highly available database and client/server applications requires a high level of expertise. This has all been encoded into Charmed MySQL K8s so that configuring TLS requires minimal effort on your end.

TLS is enabled by integrating Charmed MySQL K8s with the [Self Signed Certificates Charm](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates). This charm centralises TLS certificate management consistently and handles operations like providing, requesting, and renewing TLS certificates.

In this section, you will learn how to enable security in your MySQL K8s deployment using TLS encryption.

[note type="caution"]
**[Self-signed certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate) are not recommended for a production environment.**

Check [this guide](/t/11664) for an overview of the TLS certificates charms available.

### Configure TLS
Before enabling TLS on Charmed MySQL K8s we must first deploy the `self-signed-certificates` charm:
```shell
juju deploy self-signed-certificates --config ca-common-name="Tutorial CA"
```

Wait until `self-signed-certificates`  is up and active, use `juju status --watch 1s` to monitor the progress:
```shell
Model     Controller  Cloud/Region        Version  SLA          Timestamp
tutorial  overlord    microk8s/localhost  2.9.38   unsupported  23:04:02+01:00

App                        Version   Status  Scale  Charm                      Channel      Rev  Address         Exposed  Message
mysql-k8s                  8.0.31    active      2  mysql-k8s                  8.0/stable   36   10.152.183.234  no

Unit                          Workload  Agent  Address      Ports  Message

mysql-k8s/1                   active    idle   10.1.84.127         Unit is ready: Mode: RO
self-signed-certificates/0*   active    idle   10.1.84.71 
```

### Add external TLS certificate
To enable TLS on Charmed MySQL, relate the two applications:
```shell
juju relate mysql-k8s self-signed-certificates
```
#### Check the TLS certificate in use:
Use `openssl` to connect to the MySQL and check the TLS certificate in use:
```shell
> openssl s_client -starttls mysql -connect 10.1.84.74:3306 | grep Issuer
...
depth=1 C = US, CN = Tutorial CA
...
```
Congratulations! MySQL is now using TLS certificate generated by the external application `self-signed-certificates`.


### Remove external TLS certificate
To remove the external TLS and return to the locally generated one, remove the relation:
```shell
juju remove-relation mysql-k8s self-signed-certificates
```

#### Check the TLS certificate in use:
```shell
> openssl s_client -starttls mysql -connect 10.1.84.74:3306 | grep Issuer
```

The output should be similar to:
```shell
...
Issuer: CN = MySQL_Server_8.0.31_Auto_Generated_CA_Certificate
...
```
The Charmed MySQL K8s application reverted to the certificate that was created locally during the MySQL server installation.
