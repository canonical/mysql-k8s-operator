# Major Upgrade

> :information_source: **Example**: MySQL 8.0 -> MySQL 9.0

Currently, the charm supports MySQL 8.0 only; therefore, minor upgrades are only possible. The support of the following [MySQL LTS releases](https://blogs.oracle.com/mysql/post/introducing-mysql-innovation-and-longterm-support-lts-versions) is planned. Canonical is NOT planning to support in-place upgrades for the Major version change. The new MySQL cluster will have to be installed nearby, and the data will be copied from the old to the new installation. After announcing the next MySQL major version support, the appropriate manual will be published here.
