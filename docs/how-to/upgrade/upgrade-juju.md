# Upgrade Juju for a new database revision

This guide contains instructions to perform a patch or major/minor Juju upgrade to a controller and model containing a database charm. 

For more background about Juju upgrades in the context of database charms, check  [Explanation > Juju > Juju upgrades](/explanation/juju).

## Patch version upgrade
A [PATCH](https://semver.org/#summary) Juju upgrade (e.g. Juju `3.1.5` → `3.1.8`) can be easily applied in-place.


```text
sudo snap refresh juju 

juju upgrade-controller 
# wait until complete

juju upgrade-model 
# wait until complete
```
Once the model has finished upgrading, you can proceed with the [charm upgrade](/how-to/upgrade/perform-a-minor-upgrade).

## Major/minor version upgrade
The easiest way to perform a [MAJOR/MINOR](https://semver.org/#summary) Juju version upgrade (e.g. Juju `3.1.8` → `3.5.1`),  is to update the controller and model to the new version, then [migrate](https://juju.is/docs/juju/juju-migrate) the model.

### Commands summary
The following is a summary of commands that upgrade Juju to `3.5/stable`:

```text
sudo snap refresh juju --channel 3.5/stable

juju bootstrap lxd lxd_3.5.1 # --agent-version 3.5.1

juju migrate lxd_3.1.8:mydatabase lxd_3.5.1

juju upgrade-model -m lxd_3.5.1:mydatabase 
# wait until complete
```

Once the model has finished upgrading, you can proceed with the [charm upgrade](/how-to/upgrade/perform-a-minor-upgrade).

### Example
This section goes over the commands listed in the summary above with more details and sample outputs.

<details><summary>In this example scenario, we have <code>mysql</code> deployed in model <code>mydatabase</code> on the Juju controller <code>lxd_3.1.8</code>.</summary> 

```shell
~$ juju status

```
</details>

To upgrade Juju to `v.3.5.1`, we go through the following steps:

<details><summary>1. Update the Juju CLI</summary>

```shell
~$ juju --version
3.1.8-genericlinux-amd64

~$ sudo snap refresh juju --channel 3.5/stable

~$ juju --version
3.5.1-genericlinux-amd64
```
</details>

<details><summary>2. Bootstrap the new controller</summary>

```shell
~$ juju bootstrap lxd lxd_3.5.1 # --agent-version 3.5.1

Creating Juju controller "lxd_3.5.1" on lxd/localhost

```
</details>

<details><summary>3. Migrate the entire model <code>mydatabase</code> to the new controller (no database outage here)</summary>

```shell
~$ juju controllers
Controller  Model       User   Access     Cloud/Region         Models  Nodes    HA  Version
lxd_3.1.8*  mydatabase  admin  superuser  localhost/localhost       2      1  none  3.1.8  
lxd_3.5.1   -           admin  superuser  localhost/localhost       1      1  none  3.5.1

~$ juju models -c lxd_3.1.8
Controller: lxd_3.1.8
Model        Cloud/Region         Type  Status     Machines  Units  Access  Last connection
controller   localhost/localhost  lxd   available         1      1  admin   just now
mydatabase*  localhost/localhost  lxd   available         3      3  admin   36 seconds ago

~$ juju models -c lxd_3.5.1
Controller: lxd_3.5.1
Model       Cloud/Region         Type  Status     Machines  Units  Access  Last connection
controller  localhost/localhost  lxd   available         1      1  admin   just now

~$ juju migrate lxd_3.1.8:mydatabase lxd_3.5.1
Migration started with ID "5f227519-3cdb-4538-871c-1c4589a4598a:0"
```
</details>

<details><summary>4. Use <code>juju models</code> to check the migration process has started ( model status=<code>busy</code>). At the end of the process, the model is no longer available on the old controller as it has been moved to new controller</summary>

```shell
~$ juju models --controller lxd_3.1.8
...
mydatabase*  localhost/localhost  lxd   busy              3      3  admin   1 minute ago

~$ juju models --controller lxd_3.1.8
Controller: lxd_3.1.8
Model       Cloud/Region         Type  Status     Machines  Units  Access  Last connection
controller  localhost/localhost  lxd   available         1      1  admin   just now

~$ juju models --controller lxd_3.5.1
Controller: lxd_3.5.1
Model       Cloud/Region         Type  Status     Machines  Units  Access  Last connection
controller  localhost/localhost  lxd   available         1      1  admin   just now
mydatabase  localhost/localhost  lxd   available         3      3  admin   1 minute ago
```
</details>

<details><summary>5. Upgrade the model version itself (no database outage here)</summary>

```shell
> juju status -m lxd_3.5.1:mydatabase
Model       Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
mydatabase  lxd_3.5.1   localhost/localhost  3.1.8    unsupported  22:58:10+02:00
...

> juju upgrade-model -m lxd_3.5.1:mydatabase
best version:
    3.5.1
started upgrade to 3.5.1

> juju status -m lxd_3.5.1:mydatabase
Model       Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
mydatabase  lxd_3.5.1   localhost/localhost  3.5.1    unsupported  22:59:01+02:00
...
```
</details>

At this stage, the application continues running under the supervision of the new controller version and is ready to be refreshed to the new charm revision.

You can now proceed with the [charm upgrade](/how-to/upgrade/perform-a-minor-upgrade).
