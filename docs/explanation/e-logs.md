# Log rotation

## Overview

The charm stores its logs in `/var/log/mysql`. It is recommended to set up a [COS integration](/t/9981) so that these log files can be streamed to Loki. This leads to better persistence and security of the logs.

The following is a sample of the audit logs, with format json with login/logout records:

The following is a sample of the slowquery log:

```shell

# Time: 2023-10-23T22:22:47.564327Z
# User@Host: serverconfig[serverconfig] @ localhost [127.0.0.1]  Id:    21

SET timestamp=1698099752;
do sleep(15);
```

The charm currently has error and general logs enabled by default, while slow query logs are disabled by default. All of these files are rotated if present into a separate dedicated archive folder under the logs directory.

We do not yet support the rotation of binary logs (binlog, relay log, undo log, redo log, etc).

## Log Rotation Configurations

For each log (audit, error, general and slow query):

- The log file is rotated every minute (even if the log files are empty)
- The rotated log file is formatted with a date suffix of `-%V-%H%M` (-weeknumber-hourminute)
- The rotated log files are not compressed or mailed
- The rotated log files are owned by the `snap_daemon` user and group
- The rotated log files are retained for a maximum of 7 days before being deleted
- The most recent 10080 rotated log files are retained before older rotated log files are deleted

The following are logrotate config values used for log rotation:

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| su | snap_daemon snap_daemon |
| createoldddir | 770 snap_daemon snap_daemon |
| hourly | true |
| maxage | 7 |
| rotate | 10080 |
| dateext | true |
| dateformat | -%V-%H%M |
| ifempty | true |
| missingok | true |
| nocompress | true |
| nomail | true |
| nosharedscripts | true |
| nocopytruncate | true |
| olddir | archive_error / archive_general / archive_slowquery |

## HLD (High Level Design)

There is a cron job on the machine where the charm exists that is triggered every minute and runs `logrotate`. The logrotate utility does *not* use `copytruncate`. Instead, the existing log file is moved into the archive directory by logrotate, and then the logrotate's postrotate script invokes `juju-run` (or `juju-exec` depending on the juju version) to dispatch a custom event. This custom event's handler flushes the MySQL log with the [FLUSH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/flush.html) statement that will result in a new and empty log file being created under `/var/snap/charmed-mysql/common/var/log/mysql` and the rotated file's descriptor being closed.

We use a custom event in juju to execute the FLUSH statement in order to avoid storing any credentials on the disk. The charm code has a mechanism that will retrieve credentials from the peer relation databag or juju secrets backend, if available, and keep these credentials in memory for the duration of the event handler.
