# Logs

This explanation goes over the types of logging in MySQL and the configuration parameters for log rotation.

The charm currently has audit and error logs enabled by default. All of these files are rotated if present into a separate dedicated archive folder under the logs directory. We do not yet support the rotation of binary logs (binlog, relay log, undo log, redo log, etc).

We do not yet support the rotation of binary logs (binlog, relay log, undo log, redo log, etc).

## Log types

The charm stores its logs in `/var/log/mysql`. 

```shell
$ ls -lahR /var/log/mysql

/var/log/mysql:
drwxrwx--- 2 mysql mysql 4.0K Oct 23 20:46 archive_audit
drwxrwx--- 2 mysql mysql 4.0K Oct 23 20:46 archive_error
-rw-r----- 1 mysql mysql 1.1K Oct 23 20:46 audit.log
-rw-r----- 1 mysql mysql 1.1K Oct 23 20:46 error.log

/var/log/mysql/archive_audit:
-rw-r----- 1 snap_daemon root         43K Sep  3 01:24 audit.log-20240903_0124.gz
-rw-r----- 1 snap_daemon root        109K Sep  3 01:25 audit.log-20240903_0125.gz

/var/log/mysql/archive_error:
-rw-r----- 1 mysql mysql 8.7K Oct 23 20:44 error.log-43_2045.gz
-rw-r----- 1 mysql mysql 2.3K Oct 23 20:45 error.log-43_2046.gz
```

It is recommended to set up a [COS integration] so that these log files can be streamed to Loki. This leads to better persistence and security of the logs.

### Audit logs
The Audit Log plugin allows all login/logout records to be stored in a log file.

## Log rotation configuration

Following the configuration options exposed by the charm:

| Configuration option | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugin-audit-enabled` | Enable or disable the audit log | `true` |
| `logs_audit_policy` | The audit log policy ("all", "logins", "queries") | `logins` |
| `logs_retention_period` | The number of days to keep the rotated logs | `auto` |

The `logs_retention_period` option accepts an integer value of 3 or greater, or the special value
`auto`. When set to "auto" (default), the retention period is 3 days, except when COS-related,
where it is 1 day

For each log (audit, error):

- The log file is rotated every minute (even if the log files are empty)
- The rotated log file is formatted with a date suffix of `-%V-%H%M` (-weeknumber-hourminute)
- The rotated log files are compressed but not mailed
- The rotated log files are owned by the `snap_daemon` user and group
- By default the rotated log files are retained for 3 days before being deleted, but this can be configured.

The following are logrotate config values used for log rotation:

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `su` | snap_daemon snap_daemon |
| `createoldddir` | 770 snap_daemon snap_daemon |
| `hourly` | true |
| `maxage` | 7 |
| `rotate` | 10080 |
| `dateext` | true |
| `dateformat` | -%V-%H%M |
| `ifempty` | true |
| `missingok` | true |
| `compress` | true |
| `nomail` | true |
| `nosharedscripts` | true |
| `nocopytruncate` | true |
| `olddir` | archive_<log_name> |

## High Level Design

There is a cron job on the machine where the charm exists that is triggered every minute and runs `logrotate`. The logrotate utility does *not* use `copytruncate`. Instead, the existing log file is moved into the archive directory by logrotate, and then the logrotate's postrotate script invokes `juju-run` (or `juju-exec` depending on the juju version) to dispatch a custom event. This custom event's handler flushes the MySQL log with the [FLUSH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/flush.html) statement that will result in a new and empty log file being created under `/var/log/mysql` and the rotated file's descriptor being closed.

We use a custom event in juju to execute the FLUSH statement in order to avoid storing any credentials on the disk. The charm code has a mechanism that will retrieve credentials from the peer relation databag or juju secrets backend, if available, and keep these credentials in memory for the duration of the event handler.
